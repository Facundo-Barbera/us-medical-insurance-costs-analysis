# Exploratory Data Analysis of U.S. Medical Insurance Costs
This project,
provided by Codecademy as part of the Data Science Foundations course,
explores a dataset of medical insurance costs for individuals in the U.S.
using statistical analysis techniques in Python 3.11 and Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

Note:
Before doing anything!
Please note that there is a `reports` directory in this project.
This directory contains the reports that I have generated using the Jupyter Notebook environment.
These are HTML files that can be opened in any browser thus don't require Jupyter Notebook to be installed.
Installing Jupyter can be troublesome, so I recommend opening the reports in the `reports` directory.

If you want to run the project yourself, you will need to install any of the following:
- Python 3.11+
- Conda environment(s)

Both of these installations require Jupyter to be installed,
but Conda evniroments might have them installed by default
depending on your enviroment configuration.

You need to install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file if you want to run the notebook.

You can install the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Tip:
You can write `pip install -r` and then drag
and drop the `requirements.txt` file into the terminal to automatically write the path to the file)

## Usage

After installing Conda or Jupyter and other dependencies,
you can run the project by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

I strongly recommend you first `cd` into the project directory before running the command above,
since it might be difficult to find the notebook otherwise.
If you are using PyCharm, then you can execute the notebook directly in the editor.
(Very cool, huh?)

# Project Description

For this project,
you will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file
using the Python skills that you've developed.
This dataset and its parameters will seem familiar
if you've done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path.

However,
you're now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset
and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data!
We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do,
but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

# Project Objectives

- Work locally on your own computer
- Import a dataset into your program
- Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
- Use libraries to assist in your analysis
- Optional: Document and organize your findings
- Optional: Make predictions about a datasetâ€™s features based on your findings

## Personal Notes

Firstly, I want to point out that this is my first Data Science project.
I am really happy with the results.
I have learned a lot about the Python programming language and the Jupyter Notebook environment.
I also want to point out that this is not a data interpretation project.
This is a project that focuses on the use of Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze a dataset.

## Contributing

With the previous in mind, I am not looking for contributions to this project.
I will accept suggestions and minor fixes, but I will not accept any major changes.

This is a finished project.
