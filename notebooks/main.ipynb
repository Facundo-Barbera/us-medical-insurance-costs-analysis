    "This time I would like to take a different approach to this project.Last time I tried to work on this the pace was really fast, I often lost track of my progress, asking myself why I did certain things in the first place.This was mostly due to my high dependence on A.I. when working on, well, anything related to this project. Although I believe A.I. generated code is not inherently bad, it limited my understanding of the project progression, because even though I was guiding the project, I was not immersed in it. This notebook will serve as a dump for me to try multiple things, even if they seem unnecessary from a data science perspective. I will dump the final result of my research on a notebook called \"report.ipynb\"\n",
